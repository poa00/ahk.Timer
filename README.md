## Setup
This is an AutoHotkey script. You can download the latest version of AutoHotkey from [ahkscript.org](http://ahkscript.org/download/).

You need to run DOTA 2 as a borderless window in order to use this timer script.

You can configure any color you'd like for the different stages of the roshan cycle under the "Configurable Variables" section of the script.

You can also configure any key combination you'd like to start/pause and clear the timer under the "Keybinds" section at the bottom of the script.

## Default Keybinds
Start/Pause timer: Ctrl + Shift + Space

Clear timer: Pause
